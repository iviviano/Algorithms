>A *graph* is a [[Set]] of points with lines connecting some of the points. The points are called [[node]]s or [[vertices]] and the lines are called [[edge]]s.

>[!def]
> A graph $G$ is a way of encoding pairwise relationships among a [[set]] of objects. Thus, $G$ consists of a pair of [[set]]s $(V, E)$: a collection $V$ of [[node]]s and a collection $E$ of [[edge]]s, each of which 'joins' two of the nodes. 

>[!note]
>Graphs are drawn with circles to represent [[node]]s and line segments between nodes to represent [[edge]]s.
