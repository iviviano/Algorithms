mathLink: Chomsky normal form
---
>[!def]
>A [[Context-Free Grammar]] is in *Chomsky normal form* if every [[Substitution Rule]] is of the form $$\begin{align}A \rightarrow&BC \text{ where }A\in V \text{ and }\\ A \rightarrow &a\end{align}$$where $a$ is any [[Terminal]] and $A,B,C$ are any [[Variable]]s, but $B,C$ are not the [[Start Variable]]. The rule $S \rightarrow \epsilon$ is also allowed for the [[Start Variable]] $S$.
