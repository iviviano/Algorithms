mathLink: closure of context-free languages
---
>[!thm]
>The class of [[Context-Free Languages]]s are [[Closed Under an Operation]] under the [[Regular Operation]]s [[Union]], [[Language Concatenation]]ion, and [[Star]].

>[!proof]

Union: 
Let $G_{1}=(V_{1},\Sigma,R_{1},S_{1})$ have the [[Language]] $A$ and $G_{2}=(V_{2},\Sigma,R_{2},S_{2})$ have the [[Language of a Grammar]] $B$ with $V_{1}â‰ V_{2}$

Construct a new [[Context-Free Grammar]] $G=(V,\Sigma,R,S)$: $$\begin{align*}
V&= V_{1}\cup V_{2}\cup\{S\}\\
R&= R_{1}\cup R_{2}\cup\{S \rightarrow S_{1}|S_{2}\}
\end{align*}$$
If $w\in A$, then $G_{1}$ [[Derive]]s $w$, $\xRightarrow{*}$
