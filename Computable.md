>A [[Function]] $f:\Sigma^{*}\rightarrow \Sigma^*$ is a *computable* function if some [[Turing Machine]] [[Halt]]s with just $f(w)$ on its tape for every [[String]] $w$.

Equivalently, a [[Function]] $f$ is [[Computable]] if some [[Turing Machine]] [[Decide]]s the [[Language]] $f(\Sigma^{*})$

Anything a [[Turing Machine]] can do without [[Loop]]ing, including running [[Decider]]s is computable.
