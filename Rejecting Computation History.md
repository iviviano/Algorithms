mathLink: rejecting computation history
---
>[!def]
>Let $M$ be a [[Turing Machine]] and $w$ an input [[String]]. A *rejecting computation history* for $M$ on $w$ is a [[Sequence]] of [[Configuration]]s $C_{1},\ldots,C_{n}$ where $C_1$ is the [[Start Configuration]] of $M$ on $w$, $C_{n}$ is an [[Rejecting Configuration]] of $M$, and each $C_i$ [[Yield]]s $C_i+1.$
