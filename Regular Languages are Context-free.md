mathLink: regular languages are context-free
---
>[!prop]
>Every [[Regular Language]] [[Language]] is generated by a [[Context-Free Grammar]]

>[!proof] Proof 1
Use structural induction on [[Regular Expression]]s: Three base cases: $$\begin{align*}
\varnothing: S &\rightarrow S\\
\varepsilon: S &\rightarrow \varepsilon\\
\forall t\in \Sigma: S&\rightarrow t\\
\end{align*}$$
Inductive cases: 
>- $R_{1}R_{2}$ can be generated as the [[Language Concatenation]]ion of two [[Context-Free Languages]], so it is a [[Context-Free Languages]] by the [[Closure of Context-free Languages]]
>- $R_{1}|R_{2}$ can be generated by the [[Language Union]] of two [[Context-Free Languages]], so it is a [[Context-Free Languages]] by the [[Closure of Context-free Languages]]
>- $R^*$ can be generated by the [[Star]] of a [[Context-Free Languages]], so it is a [[Context-Free Languages]] by the [[Closure of Context-free Languages]]


>[!proof] Proof 2

Let $M=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_{0},F)$ be a [[Deterministic Finite Automaton]]. Let $G=(V,\Sigma,R,S)$ be a [[Context-Free Grammar]] defined by $$\begin{align*}
V&= Q\\
R&= \{q \rightarrow tr| q\in Q,t\in \Sigma,\text{ and } \delta(q,t)=r\}\\
S&= q_{0}
\end{align*}$$
