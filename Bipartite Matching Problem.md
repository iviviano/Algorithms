>A *matching* is a [[Set]] of [[edge]]s $M\subseteq E$ such that no two [[edge]]s in $M$ share an endpoint. 

>[!def]
>A matching $M$ is said to be a *perfect matching* if every vertex is matched.

Input:
- Bipartite [[Graph]] $G=(V,E)$

Output:
- Matching that includes a maximal amount of matching
