**# HW B Rubric

## Buckets

They were expected to recreate a procedure from each of the following:

1) HW1 or HW2
2) HW3
3) HW4

If a group of two: 

4) An additional problem (HW1, HW2, HW3, or HW4)
5) Another problem (HW3 or HW4 only) 

It's OK (although not excellent) if they only do _one_ of firsts and rests, not both. 

## Guidelines

Students were expected to implement 3 (or 5, if in a group) different programs. 
If someone is working alone, they have a 20 point baseline. If it is a group, they do not. 

For each of them, allocate 20 points for folks working alone, or 16 per problem for a joint: 

- 5 points for some code submitted, regardless of whether it runs or computes correctly
    - 2 points maximum here if the program is from the wrong "bucket" (see above)
- 10 points for correctness
    - 5 points for the function, at a glance, implements the idea correctly 
    - 3 points for being able to run/call/execute it 
    - 2 points for "style": it's functional, it uses language primitives, etc. (be generous, only subtract if, say, for loops....)
- 5 (or 1) points for some comments or notes regarding the process of solving that problem in experience.md and/or inline. 

Give them the following points for experience.md (20 points, Documentation & Description)
- 5 points if it exists and
- 5 points if it clearly has at least one reference/note about resources
    - Max 3 if no mention of their Homework A Guide 
- 5 points if there are notes about the process, what they tried, what was hard, etc.
- 5 points if clearly well documented/cited (multiple links, notes, etc.)

They were not expected to write formal tests for HWB. However, if they did, give them a nice note! 

## Rubric

FOR SOMEONE WORKING ALONE: 
    Submission                           / 20 
    3 Problem Implementations:           / 60
    Documentation and Description:       / 20
    Total                               / 100

FOR A GROUP: 
    5 Problem Implementations:           / 80
    Documentation and Description:       / 20
    Total                               / 100**
