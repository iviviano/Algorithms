Great job! Good examples and detailed descriptions. Your citations were fine, but for HWB, you must describe how you used/adapted the source as well as provide the link.

Notes:
- Your are correct that OCaml implements if-then conditions, but the syntax you gave is wrong. The OCaml syntax is `if _ then _` or `if _ then _ else _`.
- `_`, not `-`, is used for anonymous expressions
