Great job! You didn't sign the Honor Code, so your grade will not be input to campuswire until you do so.

Great job! Good examples and detailed descriptions. Your citations were fine, but for HWB, you must describe how you used/adapted the source as well as provide the link.

## Daniel

Honor Code: yes

Notes:
- Your are correct that OCaml implements if-then conditions, but the syntax you gave is wrong. The OCaml syntax is `if _ then _` or `if _ then _ else _`.
- `_`, not `-`, is used for anonymous expressions

## Janny (Extension, due Sunday 24)

Honor Code: yes

Notes:
- You do not need to asterisks at the start of a comment. `(* ... *)` is also correct. The `(** ... *)` is used for documentation, like javadoc
