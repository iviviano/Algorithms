Problem  1:         10/10
Problem  2:         10/10
Problem  3:         9/10 Your implementation correctly identifies whenever the elements of sublist appear in biglist in order. However, it does not determine whether they appear consecutively. For example, (has-sublist? '(x y z) '(a x y b z)) should return #f. One way to fix this is with a helper predicate that recognizes if the elements of a sublist are the first elements of a biglist. 
Problem  4:         7/10 Incomplete procedure. Lost 1 additional point on tests for not having a test where the sublist is not in the biglist.
Problem  5:         10/10
Problem  6:         8/10 Your implementation fails for all nonempty lists, since you call second on the list. 
Problem  7:         10/10
Problem  8:         9/10 Your implementation of all-exchange is circular. For example, (all-exchange '(a c) '(c a) '(c))should return '(a) instead of '(c).
TOTAL:              93/100

Nice job overall, especially with tests. For future, use the default Dr Racket indentation and follow this format for your tests:
```
(test-equal? "label"
              test
              expected)
```
These will make your code more readable.
I saw your commit messages. Remember that you can ask for an extension *before the due date* if you won't be able to finish a homework on time.
