Problem  2:         -/10
Problem  3:         -1/10 Your implementation correctly identifies whenever the elements of sublist appear in biglist in order. However, it does not determine whether they appear consecutively. For example, (has-sublist? '(x y z) '(a x y b z)) should return #f. One way to fix this is with a helper predicate that recognizes if the elements of a sublist are the first elements of a biglist. 
Problem  4:         -2/10 Incomplete procedure.
