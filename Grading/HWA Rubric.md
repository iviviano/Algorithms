# Homework A Grading Guide 

Students needed to submit their preference for HWA/B via a Google Form. The spreadsheet was shared with you via email to make sure that they did so by the deadline. 
Give 12 points if they did, 7 points if they did not.

Each question in Sections A & B (Overview and Language Properties) is worth 6 points, broken down by the following:
+ 3 points for answering the question at all
+ 3 points for citing a source for the question's answer (this can be in Section D or otherwise)

General guidelines:
- Be relatively ruthless about citations: that is part of the assignment requirements. If it's not clear, take off 1 point. Take off 3 if citations are missing.
- Hyperlinks are an OK citation method, but please leave a note that this is not acceptable for HWB (it needs to be both the source and _what_ or _how_ it was adapted!)
- Reminder to do a *full pass* through your set of guides to normalize for the answers and the amount of overall detail for each response 

Section C should list the first 5 steps that people should take to work with the language (5 points for each step, do not grade on quality, only completion!)
