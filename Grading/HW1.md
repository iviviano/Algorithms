Great job! When writing curried versions of procedures you have already written, you can use existing procedure. For example, you could have done 
```
(define (make-all-same pred)
	(lambda (lst) (all-same? pred lst)))
```
The same applies to `curry-delete-second`. Full credit for your implementations, but you will use currying again in the future and this can save you some time :)
