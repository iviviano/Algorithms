Great job! When writing curried versions of procedures you have already written, you can use existing procedure. For example, you could have done 
```
(define (make-all-same pred)
	(lambda (lst) (all-same? pred lst)))
```
The same applies to `curry-delete-second`. Full credit for your implementations, but you will use currying again in the future and this can save you some time :)
Nice, thoughtful, and concise tests. Your test suites demonstrated general procedure functionality and possible edge cases without redundant examples. Excellent work!

Problem  3:             10/10 Nice use of a helper function. Note that the third case of the cond in `is-in?` is redundant.
Problem  4:             10/10
Problem  5:             15/15
Problem  6:             10/10 When possible, style conventions prefer to use a single cond with more conditions instead of nesting conds. There is always a balance with trying to simplify your cases. As an excersise, try to write delete-pair using one cond with four cases.
Problem  7:             10/10
Problem  8:             10/10 The same comment about nesting conds applies here.

One style note: closing parentheses should all be on the same line. Check out the racket fundamentals if you are confused https://campuswire.com/c/GD97EB223/feed/11.
