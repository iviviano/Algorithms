Great job! One note on style. For your list-traversing functions, you used `and` to check if both the first element and the rest of the list meets the tested criteria. For the future, it is better style to use the test on the first element as your condition and let testing the rest be what you return. For example, the third case of `all-atoms?` could have condition `(atom? (first lst)` and return a recursive call. No points off, but this can help make your code more readable and concise.

Great job overall and good comments on `arith`. One style note: closing parentheses should all be on the same line. Check out the racket fundamentals if you are confused https://campuswire.com/c/GD97EB223/feed/11.

Please remember to sign the Honor Code! You're grade will not be put on campus wire until you do so.

Great job with your implementations and tests. It's great that you tested for invalid inputs. For future reference, there is an easy way to throw descriptive exceptions with the error syntax. Check out the Racket documentation if you're interested https://docs.racket-lang.org/reference/exns.html#%28def._%28%28quote._~23~25kernel%29._error%29%29.

Problem  1: 10/13 Lost 3 points for not testing a singleton list. In a test suite, you should try to demonstrate a procedure's accuracy on general examples and edge cases. Typically, 2 tests will not be enough to do so.
Problem  2: 12/15 Lost 1 point for error with inputs odd and less than 10. For example, (arith 1) should return 2, but returned 1. Lost 2 points for not testing the input 0.

Great job! One style note. When your tests get more complicated in the future, it will be helpful to write the name, test, and expected value each on different lines. See the formatting of `length-tests`.
