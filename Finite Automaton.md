>[!def]
>A *finite automaton* is a $5$-[[Tuple]] $(Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_{0},F)$, where
>1. $Q$ is a finite [[Set]] called the [[States]]
>2. $\Sigma$ is an [[Alphabet]]
>3. $\delta:Q\times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$ is the [[Transition Function]]
>4. $q_{0}$ is the [[Start State]]
>5. $F\subseteq Q$ is the [[Set of Accept States]]
