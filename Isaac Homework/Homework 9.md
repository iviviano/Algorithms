(a) $s_{0}$ will satisfy the capacity constraint trivially, if $l(e)â‰¤c(e)$ for all $e\in E$. Consider the graph $G=(V,E)$ with $V=\{1,2\}$ and $E=\{(1,2)\}$. Let $c(e)=l(e)=1$ for all $e\in E$ and $d(1)=d(2)=1$. Then, there is no circulation on $G$, since the capacities do not sum to $0$. In particular, the circulation $s_{0}$ cannot satisfy the demand constraint.

(b) 


Capacity constraint: Let $e\in E$. $s(e)=s'(e)+l(e)\ge l(e)$. So,

Attach the source to each person with capacity 1. Attach every dining hall $j$ to the sink with capacity $C_{j}$. Attach each person $i$ to each dining hall in $S_i$ with capacity 1.

Compute [[Max Flow Problem]] on $G$. Return `false` if $|f|<n$.

Source $s$ with demand $-k$. Connect $s$ to each person $i$ with edge $e=(s,i)$. Let $c(e)=7$,  $l(e)=5$, and $d(i)=0$. Connect each person $i$ to each job $j\in L_{i}$ with edge $e=(i,j)$. Let $c(e)=1,l(e)=0$, and $d(i)=0$. Connect each job $j$ to the sink $t$ with edge $e=(j,t)$. Let $c(e)=1,l(e)=0$, and $d(t)=k$.
