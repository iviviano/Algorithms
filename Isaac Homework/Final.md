$$\texttt{OPT}(i,j)=l(j)-l(i)-1+\max\{\texttt{OPT}(i+1,j),\texttt{OPT}(i,j-1)\}$$
Base cases: $\texttt{OPT}(i,i)=0$ for all $i$. 

Goal: compute $\texttt{OPT}(0,k+1)$

Let $P_{i}$ be a collection of paths. We want to know if there are $k$ paths that don't overlap.

Make a vertex $i$ for each $P_{i}$. For each $i,j$, add an edge $e=\{i,j\}$. Let $w(e)=1$ if $P_{i}\cap P_{j}=\emptyset$ and $w(e)=0$ if $P_{i}\cap P_{j}â‰ \emptyset$.

Return true iff there is a collection of $k$ vertices such that the weight of any edge between them is at least 1.
