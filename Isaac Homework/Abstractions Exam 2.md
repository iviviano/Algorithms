Currently, `(parse '(1 + 2))` returns something like `(app-exp (lit-exp 1) (list (var-exp '+) (lit-exp 2)))`. To implement infix notation, we want to parse `(1 + 2)` to something like `(app-exp (var-exp '+) (list (lit-exp 1) (lit-exp 2)))`. So, in the list cases of parse, we should add a condition to check if `(cadr input)` is one of the infix procedures. Then, check the syntax and parse input to `(app-exp (var-exp (cadr input))`

Changing parse.rkt would be sufficient, as long as interp.rkt only uses the provided accessors to access fields of parse tree structs. The new struct declarations would be 
```{racket}
(struct app-exp (args proc) #:transparent)
(struct ite-exp (else then cond) #:transparent)
(struct let-exp (body exps syms) #:transparent)
```
We need to change parse so that the
