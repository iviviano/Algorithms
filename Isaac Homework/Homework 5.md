 >[!note] 2 (a) Let $V=\{a,b,c\},E=\{\{a,b\},\{b,c\}\}$. Give weights $a=2,b=3,c=2$. The greedy algorithm will choose the solution set $\{b\}$ with value $3$. However, the best solution is $\{a,c\}$ with solution $4$. (b) Let $V=\{a,b,c,d\},E=\{\{a,b\},\{b,c\},\{c,d\}\}$. Give weights $a=2,b=1,c=2,d=4$. This algorithm will choose the solution set $\{b,d\}$ with value $5$. However, a better solution is $\{a,d\}$ with value $6$. (c) 

Step 1: let $\text{OPT }(i)$ be the independent subset of $\{v_{1},\ldots,v_{i}\}$ with the highest total weight. If $j\subseteq[i]$, let $\text{val}(J)=\sum_$ Step 2: Recurrence relation $$\text{OPT }(i)=$$ >[!note] 3
