Idea: How much traffic can we route through our network?

Input: A flow network
- Directed [[Connected]] graph: $G=(V,E)$
- Source $s$, with only outgoing edges
- Sink $t$, with only incoming edges
- Capacities $c(e)≥0$ for each edge $e\in E$
	- largest possible flow through $e$

>[!def]
>A *flow* is a value $f(e)$ for each edge $e\in E$ satisfying $0≤f(e)≤c(e)$ and 

Output:
