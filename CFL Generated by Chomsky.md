>[!proof]

Given a [[Context-Free Grammar]] $G=(V,\Sigma,R,S)$ generating $A$, we construct a new [[Context-Free Grammar]] $G=V',\Sigma,R',S'$ in [[Chomsky Normal Form]] generating $A$. There are five steps: 
1. (Start) Add a new start variable
2. (Bin) Replace rules with RHS larger than two with mutiple rules each of which has a RHS of length two
3.
