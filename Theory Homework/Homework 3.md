Let $A$ be a finite [[Language]] over the [[Alphabet]] $\Sigma$. For each $a_{i}\in A$, we can construct a [[Deterministic Finite Automaton]] $M_i$ that recognizes $\{a_{i}\}$. 

For each $i$, write $$a_{i}=s_{1}\ldots, s_{n}$$Then, let $M_{i}=(Q,\Sigma,\delta,)$

Since $A$ is given by the finite [[Union]] $$A=\bigcup \{a_{i}\}$$and finite unions of [[Regular Language]] [[Language]]s are [[Regular Language]], $A$ is [[Regular Language]].
